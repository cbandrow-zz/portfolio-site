        <h2>Front-End Enginer, Designer, and All-Star Nerd.</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m a graphic designer turned front-end engineer. I strive to blend my creative talents with my coding skills to design meaningful applications and user experiences. My background in design allows me to leverage design skills to create intuitive, functional, and effective applications and software. I work and strive to be part of a team that creates software to enhance user's lives. </p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm a goofy dude who loves taking scenic drives, practicing my photography skills, and going to concerts. I'm a car nerd who often gets lost spending hours reading auto reviews and how some specific models seemlessly blend technology and functionality, making our daily lives better. On top of that, I'm always keeping my eye open for what could be the next big thing in the tech world, and I try to stay on top of tech trends. </p>
